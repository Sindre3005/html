    <h2>Medical issues and illness</h2>
    <p>Michael Jackson suffered from a variety of different medical problems such as Vitiligo, Lupus, and other issues
        that don't really fit in as illness, but more as general health problems</p>
    <h3>Vitiligo</h3>
    <p>Vitiligo is a skin condition where patches of the skin lose their pigment. This made so his skin lightened
        throughout the 80-90s, and so he used depigmentation treatments to even out the tone.</p>
    <h3>Lupus</h3>
    <p>Lupus is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks healthy cells. Jackson apparently had a mild form
        of Lupus, which can cause skin sensitivity, scarring, and increase the risk of Vitiligo.</p>
    <h3>Other health issues</h3>
    <p>Jackson suffered second-degree burns on his scalp during the filming of a pepsi commercial, leading to a long
        process of scalp and hair treatments, and potentially contributing to his later painkiller dependency.</p>
    <p>In later years of his life, Jackson suffered from insomnia and relied heavily on sedatives and painkilling meds.
        This dependency contributed to his later death from propofol intoxication.</p>
